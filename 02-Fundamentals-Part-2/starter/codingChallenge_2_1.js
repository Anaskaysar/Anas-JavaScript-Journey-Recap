CHALLENGE #1
Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new gymnastics discipline, which works differently.

Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so one average score per team).

A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team. Otherwise, no team wins!

TEST DATA 1: Dolphins scored 44, 23, and 71. Koalas scored 65, 54, and 49.

TEST DATA 2: Dolphins scored 85, 54, and 41. Koalas scored 23, 34, and 27.

/* Write your code below. Good luck! ðŸ™‚ */

/*
Create an arrow function calcAverage to calculate the average of 3 scores. This function should have three parameters and return a single number (the average score).
*/

const calcAverage = (score1, score2, score3) => (score1 + score2 + score3) / 3;
/*
Create two new variables â€” scoreDolphins and scoreKoalas, and assign the value returned from the calcAverage function to them (you will need to call this function, and pass scores as arguments). 
*/

// const scoreDolphins = calcAverage(44, 23, 71);
// const scoreKoalas = calcAverage(65, 54, 49);
const scoreDolphins = calcAverage(85, 54, 41);
const scoreKoalas = calcAverage(23, 34, 27);
console.log(scoreDolphins, scoreKoalas);


const checkWinner = (avgDolphins, avgKoalas) => {
    if (avgDolphins >= (avgKoalas * 2)) {
        console.log(`Dolphins win (${avgDolphins} vs. ${(avgKoalas)})`)
    } else if (avgKoalas >= (avgDolphins * 2)) {
        console.log(`Koalas win (${avgKoalas} vs. ${(avgDolphins)})`)
    } else {
